# Stage 3 Extended

## Status

Stage-3 V1은 **FINAL ADJUDICATION PASS — STAGE-3 V1 CLOSED**이며 frozen baseline이다.
ZiNi Improvement도 **CLOSED / V1 RETAINED**이고 미개봉 최종 holdout은 그대로 유지한다.
**Stage-3 Extended는 ACTIVE**다. 이 문서는 의존 관계에 따른 roadmap이며 고정 구현 일정이 아니다.

첫 milestone **Execution / Playback / Visualizer Foundation**은
**FINAL ADJUDICATION PASS / CLOSED (2026-10-14)**다.
자동 검증과 실제 Windows worker/profile/startup, 사용자의 packaged interactive
acceptance, 독립 Claude 감사 및 ChatGPT 최종 판정이 모두 PASS다.
[최종 판정](STAGE3_VISUALIZER_FOUNDATION_FINAL_ADJUDICATION.md)에 종료 범위와 F-1/F-2 처분을 기록했다. [Slice 5 수용 기록](STAGE3_VISUALIZER_FOUNDATION_ACCEPTANCE.md)에
수동 tester/date, 네 terminal path의 PID·job-directory cleanup 및 controls PASS를 기록했다.
Foundation 판정은 해당 milestone만 닫으며 Stage-3 Extended 전체는 계속 active다.

## Foundation — closed / integrated

- Execution integration audit: 구현에 반영되어 완료.
- Slice 1 — Execution Context + Pure Trace Playback (`cf7544b`).
- Slice 2 — Subprocess Execution Worker (`d100a49`).
- Slice 3 — Read-only Stage-3 Visualizer Window (`490a8cf`).
- Slice 4 — Application Integration + Process Lifecycle (`b9af830`; pre-Slice-5 baseline).
- Slice 5 — Acceptance / Packaging / Documentation Closeout (`18964ad`): **CLOSED**, committed/merged/pushed.

Full commit identities and the dated Git baselines are in the acceptance and final
adjudication records. `18964add02c508d67429ef29cb59ce879c01017d` is the Slice 5
documentation closeout / independent-audit baseline, not a permanent latest HEAD.
Current components are `Stage3Execution`, worker, parent-owned `Stage3ExecutionJob`,
launcher, pure `Stage3TracePlayer` and execution-only viewer. Indexed
`EXPERT_GENERAL_V1` execution is independent of the current Live/Replay board.

## Foundation final adjudication — CLOSED

Historical 2026-10-14 Foundation acceptance and user-performed packaged manual acceptance are complete.
Normal success, Cancel, launcher-close and main-close during active jobs passed,
with each owned worker gone and job directory removed. Parent PID 5352 also exited
on main close. Playback, responsiveness and retained-result reopen passed.
The Foundation documentation closeout changed no production Python, profile or playback-seek behavior.
Source tests: **1628 passed, 0 failures/errors/skips** in the development environment.
The independent audit also passed: focused **122**, frozen protection **92**,
Stage-2 / ZiNi / Replay / Stage-3 benchmark boundary **86**, full suite **1628**
with **0 failures/errors/skips**, and packaged-worker deterministic equivalence.
ChatGPT final adjudication: **BLOCKER 0 / REQUIRED production 0**.
F-1 is the required documentation-only historical/current-state correction,
addressed by this closeout; it is not an implementation blocker.
F-2 remains **OPTIONAL / DEFER** for future worker/release transport hardening.
That Foundation closeout published no release/tag.

## Version / Settings Identity Separation — CLOSED

**FINAL ACCEPTANCE PASS / CLOSED (2026-10-15)**.
[Closeout evidence](STAGE3_IDENTITY_SEPARATION_CLOSEOUT.md) records the live
implementation baseline, 376 focused / 1639 full tests (zero failures/errors/skips),
fresh Windows package/profile/worker equivalence and user-performed native GUI PASS.

- Public Fixed Identities (`858dc1a`): immutable fixed V1 algorithm identity,
  physical-owner identity descriptor and unchanged benchmark snapshot consumers.
- Identity-backed Visualizer Labels (`e04d4e8`): separate Algorithm / Physical
  labels and a current `Playback: Index · N ms/step (presentation)` label.

| Identity | Current ownership / meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Application/release | Release/tag/build documentation; no runtime version constant, and current main is not historical v0.2.0 |
| Stage-3 algorithm | `stage3_identity.STAGE3_V1_IDENTITY`; distinct from telemetry semantic version and execution configuration |
| Physical model/profile/table | `stage3_physical.MODEL_C_V1_IDENTITY` and substantive authentication; `Model C` alias is separate |
| Playback/presentation | Viewer-local Index/interval state, 20..5000 ms, default 200 ms; no QSettings or presentation version |

`Stage3Execution(spec, board, result)`, worker transport and all frozen semantics
remain unchanged. No migration, selectors, registry or new runtime app version.

## Next active milestone — Modeled-Time Playback / Synthetic Smooth Cursor Presentation

Both features remain unimplemented. Future animation is presentation data only;
it must not alter recorded `modeled_action_us`, planner inputs or Model C identity,
and synthetic movement must not be described as an actual OS trajectory.

## Later candidates

- Same-board Human / Stage-2 / Stage-3 comparison.
- Representative-board demonstrations and Timeline Analytics as needed.
- First actual Extended algorithm research: likely nearest **exact-minimum-risk**
  guess among equal-risk candidates, using physical cost. This is a candidate,
  not an adopted policy or authorization to modify V1.

External screen-recording tools remain the default for demonstrations.

## Deferred / evidence-triggered

- Runtime application/release display or version constant.
- Selectable algorithms/profiles and durable cross-version Stage3Execution transport.
- Persistent Stage-3 presentation settings; presentation settings dataclass until an external consumer exists.
- Known-mine / no-flag execution.
- Action-specific OPEN / FLAG / CHORD timing.
- Anisotropy.
- CPS / burst constraints.
- Richer / longer planning.

Revisit only with evidence and a separate specification/evaluation contract.
Arbitrary Stage-3 seeks continue to rebuild from index 0. Incremental-forward
optimization remains deferred until modeled-time/smooth-animation requirements
or measured lag justify it; the manual report includes no quantitative lag result.

Manual UX follow-ups are nonblocking and unimplemented: clearer Run/new-execution
versus 결과 열기/retained-result labels, smooth **synthetic/interpolated** cursor
motion, and Modeled-Time Playback for inspecting Model-C action durations. A future
cursor path must not be described as an actual OS mouse trajectory. Final WON
with Step 0/current PLAYING is correct; the 20–5000 ms presentation interval is
intentional and separate from Model C; manual seek stopping autoplay is accepted.
Endpoint/straight-line cursor presentation remains accepted modeled displacement,
not an actual OS trajectory. See the acceptance and final adjudication records
for the full KEEP/DEFER observations and the unfixed F-2 transport case.

## Boundaries and references

`Replay != Stage-3 Trace Playback != ZiNi Trace`. The viewer never supplies solver
decision input. Playback interval is not Model C time, CPU speed or human speed.
V1 official 100k results, algorithm, profile and qualification remain frozen.
Extended is separate scope and does not reopen accepted V1 or closed ZiNi work.

official 100k artifacts and historical decisions retain their identities and locations.
